# ECG Denoising

## Main Goal

## Type of noise in ECGs

In this section, we will describe all the predominant types of noise in ECG signals, and we will use the sinusoidal signal formula to simulate them:

$s(t)=A×sin⁡(\omega \times t+\phi)$

• $A$ is the amplitude
• $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $\omega = 2\pi f$ with $f$ the frequency
• $t$ is the time step
• $\psi$ is the initial phase

### Power-Line Interference Noise (**PLI**)

PLI noise is caused by signal cables running from the examination room to the monitoring equipment, which are exposed to electromagnetic fields at 50 Hz or 60 Hz, generated by omnipresent power supply lines.

High-frequency noise is induced by capacitive coupling, which refers to the energy transfer between two circuits through a capacitance that decreases as the distance between the circuits increases.
In contrast, low-frequency noise is generated by inductive coupling, which occurs when current flowing through a wire produces a magnetic field that induces current in nearby wires.

To create such a signal we are using sinusoidal signal : 
$$PIL_{50,60Hz}(t) = A \times sin(2\pi(50,60)t + \phi)$$  

### Baseline Wander (BW)

Variations in electrode-skin impedance (the electrical resistance between the electrode and the skin), caused by factors such as humidity, skin characteristics, or the pressure of the electrode on the skin, as well as patient movements, electrode displacement, and breathing, can generate BW noise.
This type of noise is characterized by an unstable isoelectric line that shifts over time.
Its frequency is generally below 1 Hz, but in certain situations — such as during transport in ambulances — this frequency can be higher.

An approximation of this signal can be :
$$BW_f(t) = A \times sin(2\pi ft + \phi)$$

# Running the project

Make sure to follow the steps to be able to run the project  :
    
1. Create an virtual environment activate it and install the dependencies : 
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
